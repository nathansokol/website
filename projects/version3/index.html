							"Nathan was assigned several tasks during his Internship at Hewlett Packard related to code refactoring, software configuration management, database migration, and build automation. Not only did he exceed expectations of what he was asked to deliver, he exemplified organizational agility and how to solve complex problems in an Enterprise Application environment. The hands-on experience acquired prior to graduating and his ability to work in a high-paced environment puts him at a level over and above his peers. For that reason, I would recommend him for any future opportunity or endeavor"
